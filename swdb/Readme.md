# SWDB

This subtree contains the original SWDB files in their orginal
directories. The files have been minimially tweaked to get them to run on Colab. 

By organizing things this way, it is clear what is orginal Allen
Institute content and what is Jupyter Book rigmarole (which is in a
separate directory `jupyter_book`.  Additionally, updated to SWDB_202*
will be easier.
