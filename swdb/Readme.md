# SWDB

This subtree contains the original SWDB files in their orginal
directories, colabified. By organizing things this way, a PR could
easily be generated to merge this subtree back into the original
SWDB_* repo. Such a merge is not actually expected to happen, it is
simply to demonstrate that it could be done.
